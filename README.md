ShrijiLang was created by a single independent developer.

There was no company, no funding, and no ready-made framework behind this project.
Only long hours of learning, building, breaking, and rebuilding until a working
language engine was formed.

This project exists because I believe that computing should also reflect
Indian thinking — clarity, balance, logic, and responsibility — not only speed
and abstraction.

ShrijiLang is not built to impress.
It is built to be correct, stable, and meaningful.

The goal is simple:
Create a language that can grow into systems that think, decide, and serve
real human needs.
